Rapid Evolution is a unique music library tool for DJs,
release by Mixshare.com.  Please visit the website for
additional information, such as a user guide, forum and
online harmonic music database.

This software is free, because I feel it can be a great 
asset to the DJ community.  If you find the software useful,
please spread the word to your friends!  You can also make
donations from the software section on the website.

Please share your ideas or feedback!  Enjoy :-)
